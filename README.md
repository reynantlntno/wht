# WHT (Work in Progress)

## Overview

`wht` is a Python program designed to emulate a 'terminal' within a terminal. 
Please note that this is a work in progress, and there is a significant amount of development required.

## Usage

Download the zip file from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/reynantlntno/wht) and extract it to a directory. 
Run the file from there. You can execute the program directly from the terminal (tested on MacBook Air M1, Late 2020, running macOS Sonoma 14.0).

## Releases

Executable files for aarch64, (x86_64 support soon) architectures are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/reynantlntno/wht/releases) section. Download the appropriate executable file for your system.
